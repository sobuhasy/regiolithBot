# 🪐 RegolithBot: Autonomous Mars Excavation Simulator

**RegolithBot** is a modular Python-based system designed to simulate robotic excavation, terrain analysis, and regolith classification for future Mars colonies.

Currently under active development, it lays the foundation for AI-assisted construction, habitat planning, and in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) on the Martian surface.

## ✅ Completed Modules

### 1. `terrain_mapping.py`
Simulates Martian terrain using LiDAR/stereo depth data (or synthetic input).  
Includes:
- Elevation map generation
- Slope analysis
- Flat zone detection (for construction or excavation)
- Terrain visualization
- Export to 3D point cloud (Open3D compatible)

---

### 2. `sample_analysis.py`
Models in-situ chemical analysis of regolith samples using simulated spectrometry.  
Includes:
- Composition breakdown (e.g. Fe₂O₃, SiO₂, H₂O, perchlorates, etc.)
- Automated sample classification:
  - 💧 Water Extraction Candidate
  - 🏗️ Construction Grade
  - 🟡 Mixed Utility
  - ⚠️ Hazardous (toxic)
- JSON report export

---

### 3. `excavation_planner.py`
Generates a priority map by combining terrain flatness and sample utility to guide where robots should dig.  
Includes:
- Scoring system based on regolith classification
- Terrain penalty for non-flat zones
- Top excavation site selection
- Heatmap visualization of excavation zones

---

## 🚧 In Progress

### 4. `main.py`
This orchestration script will:
- Tie all modules together
- Generate terrain and sample data
- Run excavation planning
- Control future robotic actions (via arm controller)

Estimated: **WIP**

---

### 5. `arm_control.py`
Simulates robotic arm behavior for:
- Targeted movement using (mock) inverse kinematics
- Digging operations
- Gripper actions (grab/release)
- Sample transport

Estimated: **WIP**

---

## 📦 Project Goals

- Provide an extensible, modular pipeline for Martian regolith research
- Visualize terrain + excavation maps in Python
- Train future AI-based excavation and planning agents
- Enable hardware integration with ROS in later phases
